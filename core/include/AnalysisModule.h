/**  \brief Abstract base class for all analysis modules, independent of SFrame
 * 
 * To implement an analysis, derive from this class and override the 'process' method, which
 * will be called for each event.
 *
 * Derived classes of AnalysisModules can be either constructed by other AnalysisModules or
 * by the framework in which case the C++ class name is specified in the xml configuration file.
 * In the latter use-case, the AnalysisModule is called a 'top-level' module. In order for
 * a class to be used this way, it must:
 *   - have a constructor using 'Context &' as only argument and
 *   - be registered via the UHH2_REGISTER_ANALYSIS_MODULE macro
 *
 * How the constructors for other AnalysisModules (not run via the framework) is up to the author of
 * the respective class. For many classes, it makes sense to also use a 'Context &' as constructor argument,
 * in order to be able to access event content via handles or to save histograms.
 *
 * An AnalysisModules' lifetime is limited to the processing of one dataset.
 * If multiple datasets are processed 'in one go', the framework takes care of destroying and re-constructing all
 * AnalysisModules at the transition from one to the next dataset.

     * The return value indicates whether or not the event should be kept for the output. Whether the return
     * value is actually interpreted this way is up to the caller, however; for 'top-level' analysis modules
     * (which are configured by the xml file and called by the framework), this will be the case, but if called from
     * other AnalysisModules', it depends on the conventions and implementation followed there.

/** \brief Utility class for configuration and I/O, passed to AnalysisModule constructors
 *
 * Configuration:
 * The configuration of a module is represented as key/value pairs of strings, to pass small (configuration) data to
 * the modules. A number of dataset-related keys are always present when running via SFrame:
 *  - "dataset_type" is the type as given in the SFrame xml file, should be either "MC" or "DATA"
 *  - "dataset_version" is the 'Version' of the dataset as given in the SFrame xml file
 *  - "dataset_lumi" is the integrated luminosity ('Lumi') of the dataset in pb^-1, as given in the SFrame xml file
 *  - "target_lumi" is the target luminosity in pb^-1 for MC reweighting, as specified in the SFrame xml in Cycle in 'TargetLumi'
 * 
 * Also, all the dataset-metadata is added with the prefix "meta_" (refer to the Metadata documentation for details).
 * Other keys can either be specified in the SFrame xml configuration file (see ExampleModule), or set
 * by other classes, in particular by the top-level AnalysisModule before constructing other AnalysisModules.
 * 
 * When running in CMSSW, none of the above keys is set by the framework, but all of them can be set explicitly
 * as cms.string in the 'AnalysisModule' PSet in the EDFilter configuration of NtuplerWriter.
 *
 * Histograms:
 * For writing a histogram, use the \c put method.
 *
 * Event TTree:
 * The event tree is handled by the framework, which means that reading entries and writing entries is done
 * automatically. Also most setup (reading in variables) is usually done centrally (in AnalysisModuleRunner).
 * To define event input or output beyond the standard set of variables, use
 * \c declare_event_output and \c declare_event_input.
